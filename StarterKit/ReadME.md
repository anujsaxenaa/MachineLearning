The purpose of this starter kit is to provide a script that can be generalizable to most machine learning tasks. 
This should not be mistaken for something that can directly be used on any dataset. Machine learning isn't that easy. 
I made this script using many famous python packages for purposes that come after the data exploration,
feature engineering, and understanding of the dataset is done by the researcher(probably in R or whatever).
This would marely help you in speeding up your process of by not thinking much about starting off with a blank 
python script. By most, I would like to specify the following assumptions that need to be satisfied before using this 
on any dataset.

Assumptions
===========
- All variables must be numerical in 'nature': Yes. Since I'm using scikit-learn package in my code, this is a 
necessity. This means that all categorical/textual variables must be cleaned and coded appropriately before 
implementation.
